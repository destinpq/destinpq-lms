# Real Database Operations Implementation

## Overview

I've replaced all mock data with real database operations for the LMS system. The implementation now uses TypeORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database for all CRUD operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Entities
- Created `workshop.entity.ts` - Full database schema for workshops
- Created `course.entity.ts` - Full database schema for courses
- Updated TypeORM config to include these new entities

### 2. Workshop Module
- Implemented `WorkshopsService` with TypeORM repositories
- Added data seeding for first-time initialization
- Implemented proper CRUD operations:
  - `findAll()` - Get all workshops
  - `findUpcoming()` - Get upcoming workshops
  - `findOne(id)` - Get workshop by ID
  - `findNext()` - Get next upcoming workshop
  - `create(data)` - Create new workshop
  - `update(id, data)` - Update existing workshop
  - `remove(id)` - Delete workshop
- Updated controller with proper error handling

### 3. Course Module
- Implemented `CoursesService` with TypeORM repositories
- Added data seeding for first-time initialization
- Implemented proper CRUD operations:
  - `findAll()` - Get all courses
  - `findOne(id)` - Get course by ID
  - `create(data)` - Create new course
  - `update(id, data)` - Update existing course
  - `remove(id)` - Delete course
- Updated controller with proper error handling

### 4. Authentication
- All endpoints are now protected with `JwtAuthGuard`
- Fixed TypeScript issues with null safety for database queries

## How to Test

1. Restart the backend server: `npm run start:dev` in the backend directory
2. The database tables will be automatically created and seeded with initial data
3. Use the frontend UI to interact with the real database:
   - View workshops/courses
   - Create new workshops/courses
   - Edit existing workshops/courses
   - Delete workshops/courses

## API Endpoints

### Workshops
- `GET /workshops` - Get all workshops
- `GET /workshops/:id` - Get workshop by ID
- `GET /workshops/next` - Get next upcoming workshop
- `GET /workshops/sessions/upcoming` - Get upcoming sessions
- `POST /workshops` - Create new workshop
- `PUT /workshops/:id` - Update workshop
- `DELETE /workshops/:id` - Delete workshop

### Courses
- `GET /courses` - Get all courses
- `GET /courses/:id` - Get course by ID
- `POST /courses` - Create new course
- `PUT /courses/:id` - Update course
- `DELETE /courses/:id` - Delete course

All requests must include a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.
